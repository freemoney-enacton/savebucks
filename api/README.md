# API Application

The API is built with Fastify and TypeScript. It exposes RESTful endpoints and socket services that power the web and admin applications.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Copy the example configuration if provided and set environment variables.
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Application Structure

```
src/
  app.ts        # Fastify server bootstrap
  modules/      # Feature modules and routes
  plugins/      # Fastify plugins
  service/      # Business logic services
```

## Key Features

- Fastify for a high-performance HTTP server.
- Database access through TypeScript query builders.
- Authentication and authorization middleware.

## Best Practices

- Follow REST principles when designing routes.
- Use async/await and handle errors gracefully.
- Emit logs for requests and errors.

## Deployment

Run the server with a process manager (e.g., pm2) or containerize the application. Configure environment variables for production and start with `node` or `ts-node`.
