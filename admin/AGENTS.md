# Admin Application Guide

This guide describes technical details and recommendations for the Laravel Filament admin panel.

## Architecture Overview

The application follows Laravel's MVC structure with Filament providing panel pages and resources. Most business logic resides in service classes invoked from controllers or Filament actions.

## Component Breakdown

- **Resources** – Manage CRUD interfaces for models.
- **Pages** – Custom admin pages such as dashboards or settings.
- **Widgets** – Small UI components showing stats or charts.

## Data Flow

Requests are routed through `routes/web.php` and handled by controllers or Filament resources. Models use Eloquent ORM to interact with the database.

## Security Considerations

- Authentication uses Laravel's session guard.
- Authorization is implemented through policies and the Filament Shield package.
- Sensitive configuration is stored in `.env` variables.

## Performance Optimization

- Cache heavy queries using Laravel's cache system.
- Use eager loading to avoid N+1 database issues.

## Testing Strategy

PHPUnit tests live in the `tests/` directory. Add feature tests for controllers and unit tests for services.

## Known Issues & Limitations

None documented yet. Update this file when limitations are discovered.
